Nicole Conill - CS 3041 Final

ZooAdvisor
This app serves to help users find the best Massachusetts zoo to visit, based on their desire to see specific animals. Users may add animals to their list, with the animals being pre-sorted based on classifications (birds, mammals, reptiles, etc.). When completed, the app would display results of the five Massachusetts zoos as best to worst ratings, using percentages of how many desired animals can be found at each zoo.

Currently the app has preset data to display an example of animals that could be selected, and what the zoo results would be. Not all animal pages are fully implemented.
